CA116 – Programming I (Python) Labs

This folder contains my first-year Python lab work for CA116 – Programming I.

Overview

These labs focus on building fundamental programming skills using Python, including:
	•	Variables and data types
	•	Conditional statements
	•	Loops
	•	Functions
	•	String manipulation
	•	Lists and basic data structures
	•	Problem-solving and algorithmic thinking

Purpose

The purpose of these labs was to develop a strong foundation in computational thinking and structured programming. Each lab builds on previous concepts and reinforces best practices in writing clean, logical code.

Skills Developed
	•	Writing modular Python programs
	•	Debugging and testing code
	•	Working with user input and file handling
	•	Implementing basic algorithms
	•	Breaking down problems into manageable steps

Notes

This repository reflects my early programming journey and progression in Python. The focus here is on learning core concepts.
